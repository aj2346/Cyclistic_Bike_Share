## **Capstone Project, Course 8 (Coursera)**

### *Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate*

## **Project Background**

 *Company* =
 **Cyclistic**,a bike-share company in Chicago, IL (fictional)
  
  *Cyclistic Background* 
  * A bike-share program launched in 2016 that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations.   
  * The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.
  * Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people        with disabilities and riders who canâ€™t use a standard two-wheeled bike. 
  * The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. 
  * Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.
  
  *Stakeholders*
  * Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and manager of author in this scenario.  Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns
  and initiatives to promote the bike-share program.
  * Cyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and
  reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. 
  * Cyclistic executive team: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the
  recommended marketing program.
  
   *Ask*
* Three questions will guide the future marketing program:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
  
*  *Business Task* =
  To maximize the number of annual memberships by increasing the conversion of casual riders into annual members.
   
*   *Capstone Project Objectives* =
      * Use the provided 12 month set of historical bike trip data to understand how *casual* (Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day           passes) riders & *annual* (Customers who purchase annual memberships)riders **use Cyclistic bikes differently** (*answer question #1             from above*) 
      * Provide **recommendations** towards the design of a new marketing strategy as Cyclistic's finance analysts have determined that annual           members are much more profitable than casual riders.
